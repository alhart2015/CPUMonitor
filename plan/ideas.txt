CPU MONITOR

GOAL:
  % load on each core

Maybe later:
    - Which processes are running, how much they're taking
    - A nice looking GUI

DESIGN:
  - Frontend GUI starts backend process as child process, passing command line arguments.
    - These arguments are things like the data rate.
    - This is good because it leaves room for other backend arguments to be created.
    - This is bad because the child backend process will have to be restarted to change options.
    - This would save us the complexity of another inter-process communication mechanism between the backend and GUI.
  - Backend writes different kinds of CPU information to a loopback socket.
    - Maybe this could be formatted in JSON or something so a python package could easily read it.
  - Frontend GUI read data off of the socket and displays it.
